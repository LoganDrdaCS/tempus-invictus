# Tempus Invictus

Tempus Invictus ("Time Undefeated") is a solo-developed passion project of mine that ultimately led to my pursuit of a degree in computer science. This game is a unique, strategic shooter/platformer/speedrunner with time manipulation and a genre-breaking twist: the player chooses the starting conditions of each run. With a near-infinite number of starting conditions for each level, the record for Condition A might be considered a slow run compared to the record for Condition B.

I built this game from scratch, beginning with very limited programming knowledge, and I learned a lot along the way. The concept for this game existed in my head for several years beforehand, so having a working product (that I enjoy playing!) is something that I can talk about for hours. This remains a work in progress that I steadily add to. See the [playable demo](#working-demo) below.
